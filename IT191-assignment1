	The most surprising thing I found looking for these jobs is that it is a lot easier to find jobs that want 3+ years of experience; even with a good internship, you are locked out of many jobs coming out of college.  Anything involving a well-known company requires previous work and if it is for a video game company they expect to see work outside of a job, such as a mod for a game.
	
	For the first set of jobs, jobs that I expect to be able to get right out of college, I should be able to get with only my degree.  I expect to do some independent development outside of school because ultimately I would like to get to my future jobs sooner rather than later.  I have already got 4 years professional experience and am tired of doing the corporate office circuit.
	
  I need to double check the classes I have to take to graduate, but it should give me enough general programming experience (not just Java) to get me a basic job at somewhere either on the coast or somewhere smaller/independent.  Hopefully with the experience I receive from the out-of-college jobs I can go to something a little longer lasting and more fulfilling after 2 or so years.
  
  Once I have gotten the knowledge needed from those beginner jobs, gaining both technical and professional experience, it should be fairly straightforward to get hired for any of the future jobs.  Obviously in 5 years I may have different goals, but right now this is enough to get me going on the right path.
